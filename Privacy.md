**Last Updated:** 2025/10/23

This Privacy Policy explains how **NatureID** (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application (**the App**) available on Google Play.

We value your trust and are committed to protecting your privacy and providing transparency about how data is handled.

## **1. Information We Collect**

We do **not** collect personally identifiable information directly from users.

However, our App integrates **third-party services** that may automatically collect certain data for advertising, analytics, and performance purposes.

These data types may include:

- **Device information:** such as model, operating system version, and system performance data
- **Advertising identifiers:** such as the Google Advertising ID
- **IP address and approximate location:** inferred from network information for ad delivery
- **Usage and interaction data:** including ad impressions, clicks, app openings, or feature usage
- **Crash and diagnostics data:** such as error logs or app performance information

### **Third-Party Services We Use**

- **Google AdMob** – Used for ad delivery, frequency capping, and performance measurement.
    
    AdMob may use cookies or device identifiers to deliver **personalized or non-personalized ads**, and to collect diagnostic data to ensure proper ad performance.
    
    You can learn more in [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and in How Google uses information from apps or sites that use our services.

## **2. How We Use Information**

The data collected through third-party services is used to:

We do not have access to or control over the data stored by these third parties.

## **4. Data Security and Transmission**

All communication between your device and our third-party services (such as AdMob) uses secure, encrypted protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data during transmission.

While we take commercially reasonable measures, no method of Internet transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

## **5. App Permissions**

The App requests only the minimum permissions required for its core functionality:

- **Internet access** – Required to load ads and access online resources
- **Network state access** – Used to detect connectivity for ad delivery

We do **not** request or use permissions to access personal files, contacts, camera, microphone, precise location, or similar sensitive data.

## **6. Children’s Privacy**

NatureID is **not designed for children under the age of 13**.

We do not knowingly collect, use, or share any personal data from children.

If we discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we will promptly delete it.

## **7. Your Choices and Control**
